Eden is a multi-platform cross compatible library that interfaces with a standard roomba (create 2) and wombat.
The end goal is to have a single library that allows a 1-to-1 translation from both platforms (after a unit conversion is adjusted, as well as certain measurements)
currently, the library is cross compatible, but NOT 1-to-1.
